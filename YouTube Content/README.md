The URL below links to my personal YouTube channel, which hosts multiple videos that were academic assignments or projects. 

While not technical in nature, and with some of the videos being quite silly, I wanted to include this to highlight a couple of points: 
  1) I am capable of writing, producing, and editing video content.
  2) I have experience with content creation for education and entertainment purposes.
  3) I am comfortable showcasing my personality to the world.
