Roomble was a collaborative application that I was a part of during college. The goal was to create an app that would connect individuals looking for likeminded people to be potential roommates with. The backend was built using a JSON-based Google Firebase database with Javascript directing the frontend.

All the documents in this folder are milestone reports that I wrote up for the team to convey progress of the applicatio's development to both professors and non-technical onlookers
