As an Alumni Secretary for the Alpha Iota chapter of the Kappa Kappa Psi service fraternity, I was responsible for cultivating and maintaining a community with alumni members of the fraternity. I regularly sent out email newsletters that reached the hundreds of alumni members. I established a Discord server community for alumni that cultivated into a community for reconnecting and interacting with the chapter and each other. I coordinated events for alumni to interact with active and prospective members. I created volunteer and donation opportunities for alumni to help the chapter and the fraternity.
