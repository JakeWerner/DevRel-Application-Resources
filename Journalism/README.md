I wrote several articles covering a wide-variety of topics including technology. My articles were frequently featured on the front page and were occasionally advretized to the school as a standard for quality.
As 1 of 2 copy editors, I was responsible for upholding writer quality and to help the managing editors with attracting an audience and ensuring writers maintain deadlines.
